# THM-OWASP-Top-10

**Objectives:**

The primary objective of completing the TryHackMe OWASP Top 10 2021 room was to deepen my understanding of the most critical web application security risks and gain hands-on experience in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating these vulnerabilities. The room provided an interactive learning environment where I could practice attacking and securing web applications, reinforcing theoretical knowledge with practical application.

**Skills Learned:**

**Understanding the OWASP Top 10**

  1.Gained insight into the most prevalent security risks in modern web applications.

  2.Learned how vulnerabilities are ranked based on exploitability, prevalence, and impact.

  3.Identification and Exploitation of Web Vulnerabilities

  4.Practiced recognizing and exploiting security flaws using real-world scenarios.

  5.Learned various techniques for attacking and securing web applications.

  6.Hands-On Experience with Security Tools

  7.Used tools like Burp Suite, SQLMap, and OWASP ZAP to analyze and manipulate HTTP requests.

  8.Conducted automated and manual testing to identify vulnerabilities.

# Key Takeaways from Each OWASP Top 10 Vulnerability:
